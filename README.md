# CodingChallenge

1. Dubstep
 - Input: The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters
 - Output: Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.
 - Ex: WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX -> I AM X
 
2. Digital Root
 - Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
 - Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
 - 493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
